## 1. Fault Diagnosis of Steel Wire Rope Based on Image Processing and Deep Learning

*Research Program at UESTC* 

 - *Supervisor*: [Prof. Zhiliang LIU](https://www.smee.uestc.edu.cn/info/1177/8351.htm "Prof. Zhiliang LIU's homepage"){:target="_blank"} 

 - *Time*: 09/2020 ~ 05/2023, UESTC 

 - *Program Introduction*:

   Steel wire ropes are important load-bearing components in many industrial cases. Flaws on steel wire ropes can threat the safety of the system. Magnetic flux leakage method is a promising non-destructive testing (NDT) method to detect flaws on steel wire ropes, but various kinds of noises severely influence the detection accuracy. There are two main part of this program:
   - Mechanism simulation and Hardware design: Design inspection equipment based on magnetic field simulation.
   - Algorithm: Develope new signal/image processing method or data driven method to increase the inspection performance.

 - Pan, F., Liu, Z., Ren, L., & Zuo, M. (2023). Adaptive local flaw detection based on magnetic flux leakage images with a noise distortion effect for steel wire ropes. IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics. (Impact factor = 7.7) Link.

In this study, the effect of noise distortion is analyzed and an image processing based method is proposed to solve this problem.
